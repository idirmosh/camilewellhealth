p_1: "Camille is patient, thorough and very knowledgeable. She listened to my concerns and tailored an entire program around my specific needs. Working one on one with her was a breeze, she's personable and gives easy to follow instructions. She also helped correct errors in my form to ensure efficacy and was able to modify exercises depending on my pain level. After working with her for just one week, I saw a noticeable difference in the reduction of my pain and my strength also increased. "
p_2: "Camille even took it a step further by sending detailed, fool proof instructions to continue the program on my own. I have been able to implement the exercises easily and quickly into my daily routine to maintain the wonderful results I gained with her. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to reduce their pain and increase their strength in areas that are often overlooked."
